<abstract label="Short Description of Collection" encodinganalog="520$a">The College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) began its existence as a committee of the Music Educators National Conference (MENC). The Committee on College and University Music was so dominated by band directors in the mid-1930s that it soon became known as the Committee on College and University Bands. In the fall of 1938 that committee, under the leadership of William Revelli, met independently in Chicago. The group met again in December 1941 and formed the University and College Band Conductors Conference. The name of the organization was changed to the College Band Directors National Association in 1947. The archives contain administrative records, correspondence and information bulletins, membership listings, financial records, committee reports, surveys, questionnaires, publications, articles, conference programs and proceedings, photographs, and oral histories related to the CBDNA's mission of the teaching, performance, study and cultivation of music, with particular focus on the wind band milieu.
